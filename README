SOCKETS RELAY CHAT
==================

A simple sockets based chat server and client written in javascript.


SERVER
------

The server accepts connections from multiple clients and relays messages from the sender to the rest connected clients.
The client messages can be in either of the following two forms:

    1. /USERNAME <%s>: server sets the username as the first argument
    2. /MESSAGES <%s>: server relays the message to other connected clients
  
The server listens for new connections on port 8080, to start the server run

    node server.js


CLIENT
------

The client opens a unique connection to the server and creates a command line interface for the user.
A prompt is called to accept input from the user, which is sent to the server.

The client attempts to connect to port 8080, to start the client run
  
    node client.js <SERVER_IP> <USERNAME>
